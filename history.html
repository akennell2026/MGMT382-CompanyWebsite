    <h3 style="font-family: 'Arial';">Company History</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Founded in 1980, Stride Glide first specialized in ultra-comfortable running shoes. The start-up idea stemmed from Founder Alex Foster, who could not find on the market a durable and comfortable pair of running shoes to support his hobby of running. Alex then decided to create his own brand of running shoes, intending to deliver the most comfortable pair of shoes to runners and athletes, a pair of shoes that does not hurt one’s feet, is breathable, and is fashionable. Boost was the first Stride Glide product.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Later on, with an increase in the demand for the Boost Model, Alex realized the potential of the brand and decided to expand the running shoes line to support other sports as well, such as tennis, basketball, soccer, and badminton. Sport shoes then became the brand’s signature, with thousands of pairs sold daily. We became the country’s #1 shoes sponsor for professional athletes by the end of 2005.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">People’s increased health awareness directed our mission to create a more diverse brand. In 2008, we successfully expanded our name beyond sports shoes to become a sports apparel designer and manufacturer, offering products for a wide range of sports. With the love for our famous running shoes, customers continued to support different apparel lines, once again affirm our #1 position on the sports apparel market.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">For many years, we have been investing in our research and development, hoping to bring the best products to our customers. Our mission is to design products that enhance performance and durability, promote a healthier and more active lifestyle.</p>
